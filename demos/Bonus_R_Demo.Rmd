# `plotly`, colors, and themes
  
***

###  The graphs below don't have proper titles, axis labels, legends, etc.  Please take care to do this on your own graphs.

## Use [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/) to make visuals interactive

Rather than spending a lot of time to make a fully interactive app, `plotly` makes it incredibly easy to take an existing `ggplot` object, then use the `ggplotly` function to make it interactive. For instance, let's take one of our old `penguins` plots and assign it to an object named `scatter_plain`:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

scatter_plain <- penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_bw()
scatter_plain
```


Now, we're going to load the `plotly` package and use `ggplotly` to make this plot interactive:

```{r}
library(plotly)
ggplotly(scatter_plain)
```


Notice that there are several ways you can interactive with the plot, you can filter, zoom, and get additional information by hovering over the points with the tooltip. You can also customize what's displayed in the tooltip in various ways. For instance, I can update the above plot to include `text` denoting the penguin's `sex`. Then when we call `ggplotly` we can specify what is included in the tooltip when hovering over the points:

```{r}
scatter_upd <- penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species,
             text = paste("sex:", sex))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_bw()
# Display the text with the sex variable and the penguins species with the tooltip
ggplotly(scatter_upd, tooltip = c("text", "species"))
```


## Notes on colors in plots

Three types of color scales to work with:

1. __Qualitative__: distinguishing discrete items that don't have an order (nominal categorical). Colors should be distinct and equal with none standing out unless otherwise desired for emphasis.

+ Do __NOT__ use a discrete scale on a continuous variable

2. __Sequential__:  when data values are mapped to one shade, e.g., in a choropleth, for an ordered categorical variable or low to high continuous variable

+ Do __NOT__ use a sequential scale on an unordered variable

3. __Divergent__: think of it as two sequential scales with a natural midpoint
midpoint could represent 0 (assuming +/- values) or 50% if your data spans the full scale

+ Do __NOT__ use a divergent scale on data without natural midpoint


### Options for `ggplot2` colors

The default color scheme is pretty bad to put it bluntly, but `ggplot2` has ColorBrewer built in which makes it easy to customize your color scales. For instance, we change the palette for the species plot from before.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_bw()
```

Something you should keep in mind is to pick a [color-blind friendly palette](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/). One simple way to do this is by using the `ggthemes` package which has color-blind friendly palettes included:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_bw()
```

In terms of displaying color from low to high, the [viridis scales](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html) are excellent choices (and are also color-blind friendly!).

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, 
             color = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)",
       color = "Flipper Length (mm)") +
  theme_bw()
```


## Notes on themes

We have not explicitly talked about this throughout the semester, but you have seen various changes to the `theme` of plots for customization. __You will constantly be changing the theme of your plots to optimize the display.__ Fortunately, there are a number of built-in themes you can use to start with rather than the default `theme_gray()`:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_gray()
```

For instance, you have seen me use `theme_bw()` many times throughout the semester:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_bw()
```

There are options such as `theme_minimal()`:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_minimal()
```


or `theme_classic()`:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_classic()
```


There are also packages with popular, such as the `ggthemes` package which includes, for example, `theme_economist()`:

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_economist()
```

and `theme_fivethirtyeight()` to name a couple:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

With any theme you have picked, you can then modify specific components directly using the `theme()` layer. There are [many aspects of the plot's theme to modify](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html), such as my decision to move the legend to the bottom of the figure, drop the legend title, and increase the font size for the y-axis:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)",
       title = "Larger penguins tend to have larger bills",
       subtitle = "Positive relationship between mass and length is consistent across species") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))
```


If you're tired of explicitly customizing every plot in the same way all the time, then you should make a custom theme. It's quite easy to make a custom theme for `ggplot2` and of course [there are an incredible number of ways to customize your theme](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-12-26-creating-and-using-custom-ggplot2-themes/). In the code chunk, I modify the `theme_bw()` theme using the `%+replace%` argument to make my new theme named `my_theme()` - which is stored as a function:

```{r}
my_theme <- function () {
  # Start with the base font size
  theme_bw(base_size = 10) %+replace%
    theme(
      panel.background  = element_blank(),
      plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA), 
      legend.position = "bottom",
      legend.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA),
      legend.key = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA),
      axis.ticks = element_blank(),
      panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "grey90", size = 0.3), 
      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 18, 
                                hjust = 0, vjust = 0.5, 
                                face = "bold", 
                                margin = margin(b = 0.2, unit = "cm")),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0, 
                                   vjust = 0.5, 
                                   margin = margin(b = 0.2, unit = "cm")),
      plot.caption = element_text(size = 7, hjust = 1,
                                  face = "italic", 
                                  margin = margin(t = 0.1, unit = "cm")),
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 13),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 13)
    )
}
```


Now I can go ahead and my plot from before with this theme:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)",
       title = "Larger penguins tend to have larger bills",
       subtitle = "Positive relationship between mass and length is consistent across species") +
  my_theme()
```
