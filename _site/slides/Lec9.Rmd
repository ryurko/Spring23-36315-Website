## Conceptual Review

#### Reminder: HW3 is due tonight! Graphics Critique #1 is due Feb 28th

__Last class: introduction to KS tests for comparing distributions__

Several ways to graphically compare several distributions:

  + Facetted histograms, side-by-side violin plots, overlayed densities, ECDFs
  
Graphics are extremely useful because human eyes can quickly compare and contrast distributions...

#### But when are the differences we're seeing statistically significant?

  + _Any_ distributional difference? $\rightarrow$ KS test
  
  + Just care about mean differences? $\rightarrow$ t-test
  
  + Just care about variance differences? $\rightarrow$ Bartlett's test
  
__Today: Understanding the statistical power of tests and graphics__


---

## Recap: One-Sample KS Test

+ Have a single sample $\mathbf{X} = (X_1,\dots,X_n)$

+ Want to test: Does $\mathbf{X}$ follow a particular distribution?

+ Compares the empirical CDF of $\mathbf{X}$ to the theoretical CDF of a particular distribution:

$$\underbrace{F(x) = P(X \leq x)}_{\text{theoretical CDF}}, \hspace{0.2in} \underbrace{\hat{F}(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}(X_i \leq x)}_{\text{empirical CDF}}$$

+ Null hypothesis: $\mathbf{X}$ follows a distribution with CDF $F(x)$

+ Alternative hypothesis: $\mathbf{X}$ does not follow this distribution

+ Test statistic: $\max_x |\hat{F}(x) - F(x)|$

+ If $\hat{F}(x)$ is far away from $F(x)$ $\rightarrow$ __reject null__


---

## Recap: Two-Sample KS Test

+ Have two samples $\mathbf{X} = (X_1,\dots,X_m)$, $\mathbf{Y} = (Y_1,\dots,Y_n)$

+ Want to test: Do $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ follow the same distribution?

+ Compares the empirical CDFs of $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$:

$$\underbrace{\hat{F}_X(z) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \mathbb{I}(X_i \leq z)}_{\text{empirical CDF of } \mathbf{X}} \hspace{0.2in} \underbrace{\hat{F}_Y(z) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}(Y_i \leq z)}_{\text{empirical CDF of } \mathbf{Y}}$$

+ Null hypothesis: $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ follow the same distribution.

+ Alternative hypothesis: $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ do not follow the same distribution

+ Test statistic: $\max_z |\hat{F}_X(z) - \hat{F}_Y(z)|$

+ If $\hat{F}_X$ and $\hat{F}_Y$ are far away from each other $\rightarrow$ __reject null__

## [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) [Spotify Songs](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md) - Duration by Genre

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
spotify_songs %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = duration_ms, color = playlist_genre)) +
  geom_density() +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Duration (ms)", color = "Genre") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")


```


---

## What about the difference between the pop and rap?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# Create density plot for just rap and rock
spotify_songs %>%
  filter(playlist_genre %in% c("rap", "pop")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = duration_ms, color = playlist_genre)) +
  geom_density() +
  # Use the same colors based on palette printed out from:
  # ggthemes::colorblind_pal()(6) - grabbing the last two colors
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#56B4E9", "#F0E442")) +
  labs(x = "Duration (ms)", color = "Genre") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


---

## What about the difference between the pop and rap?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# Create ECDF plot for just rap and rock
spotify_songs %>%
  filter(playlist_genre %in% c("rap", "pop")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = duration_ms, color = playlist_genre)) +
  stat_ecdf() +
  # Use the same colors based on palette printed out from:
  # ggthemes::colorblind_pal()(6) - grabbing the last two colors
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#56B4E9", "#F0E442")) +
  labs(x = "Duration (ms)", color = "Genre",
       y = "Fn(x)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


---

## Observe significant difference given large dataset size...

```{r, warnings = FALSE}
spotify_songs <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/spotify_songs.csv')
table(spotify_songs$playlist_genre)
rap_duration <- spotify_songs %>% filter(playlist_genre == "rap") %>% pull(duration_ms)
pop_duration <- spotify_songs %>% filter(playlist_genre == "pop") %>% pull(duration_ms)

ks.test(rap_duration, y = pop_duration)
```


---

## What happens if we had a smaller sample?

```{r}
set.seed(2017)
sample_songs <- spotify_songs %>%
  group_by(playlist_genre) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 100)

table(sample_songs$playlist_genre)
sample_rap_duration <- sample_songs %>% filter(playlist_genre == "rap") %>% pull(duration_ms)
sample_pop_duration <- sample_songs %>% filter(playlist_genre == "pop") %>% pull(duration_ms)

ks.test(sample_rap_duration, y = sample_pop_duration)
```


---


## But it still looks different???

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# Create ECDF plot for just rap and rock
sample_songs %>%
  filter(playlist_genre %in% c("rap", "pop")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = duration_ms, color = playlist_genre)) +
  stat_ecdf() +
  # Use the same colors based on palette printed out from:
  # ggthemes::colorblind_pal()(6) - grabbing the last two colors
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#56B4E9", "#F0E442")) +
  labs(x = "Duration (ms)", color = "Genre",
       y = "Fn(x)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


---

## Test difference between means and variances?

Can test difference in means using `t.test()`:

```{r}
t.test(sample_rap_duration, sample_pop_duration)
```


---

## Test difference between means and variances?

Can test difference in variances using `bartlett.test()`:

```{r}
bartlett.test(list(sample_rap_duration, sample_pop_duration))
```


#### Rejects at $\alpha = 0.05$ even with this smaller sample size!

+ Why did the KS test say they weren't different when the graph were clearly different? Two possible reasons:

  + The sample size might be too small to detect a difference
  
  + The KS test is known to have low power

---

## Statistical power
  
  
+ __Statistical power__ is key to really understanding graphics - you need to know when you're looking at real effects versus noise

+ Here are two definitions of power (one in English, one in math):

  + English: The probability that we reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.
  
  + Math: $P(\text{p-value} \leq \alpha | H_0$ is false)
  
--

+ Main things that affect statistical power:

  + Bigger differences in the data $\rightarrow$ more power
  
  + Smaller variance/error in differences $\rightarrow$ more power
  
  + Bigger sample size $\rightarrow$ more power
  
  + More appropriate statistical test $\rightarrow$ more power

Also remember: Type 1 error is falsely rejecting; Type 2 error is falsely failing to reject


---

## Toy example for understanding statistical power

Consider two samples:

$$(X_1,\dots,X_n) \sim N(0, 1) \\
(Y_1,\dots,Y_n) \sim N(\delta, 1)$$

Let's say we use `t.test(x, y)`

We'll simulate $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ 1000 times for some $n$ and $\delta > 0$

--

We'll count the number of times we reject

$$\text{Power} = P(\text{p-value} \leq \alpha | H_0 \text{ false}) \\
            = P(\text{p-value} \leq \alpha | \delta > 0) \\
            \approx \frac{\text{# times reject}}{1000}$$
            
We'll consider $n = 10, 20, \dots, 1000$ and $\delta = 0.1$ or $\delta = 0.25$


---

## Toy example: power of $t$-test

```{r, echo = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# This code chunk sets up the simulation data results:
ttest_power_table <-
  # First iterate over the two effect sizes:
  map_dfr(c(.1, .25),
          function(effect_size) {
            
            # Now iterate over n:
            map_dfr(seq(10, 1000, by = 10),
                    function(n_i) {
                      
                      # Run the follow 1000 times:
                      map_dfr(1:1000,
                              function(sim_i) {
                                
                                # Generate the first sample x:
                                x <- rnorm(n_i, 0, 1)
                                # And now y with the effect size:
                                y <- rnorm(n_i, effect_size, 1)
                                
                                # Compute the t.test result:
                                ttest_result <- t.test(x, y)
                                
                                # Return a table with the settings and decision
                                # to reject with respect to alpha 0.05:
                                tibble(delta = effect_size,
                                       sample_size = n_i,
                                       is_rej = 
                                         as.numeric(ttest_result$p.value <= 0.05),
                                       sim_id = sim_i)
                                
                              })
                    })
          }) %>%
  group_by(delta, sample_size) %>%
  summarize(power = mean(is_rej))
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# Generate power curve data for two effect sizes:
library(latex2exp) # package to use latex math symbols in plots
ttest_power_table %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample_size, y = power, color = as.factor(delta))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Sample size n", y = "Power (across 1000 simulations)",
       color = TeX(r'(Mean shift $\delta$)')) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")


```


---

## Another toy example 

Consider two samples:

$$(X_1,\dots,X_n) \sim N(0, 1) \\
(Y_1,\dots,Y_n) \sim N(0, 1.5)$$

Let's consider three ways to test differences:

1. `t.test(x, y)`

2. `bartlett.test(list(x, y))`

3. `ks.test(x,y)`

We'll simulate $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ 1000 times for samples sizes $n = 10, 20, \dots, 1000$

__What do you think the power curves will look like for these methods?__

---

## Comparison of power for the different tests

```{r, echo = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# This code chunk sets up the simulation data results:
comp_power_table <-
  # Iterate over n:
  map_dfr(seq(10, 1000, by = 10),
          function(n_i) {
            
            # Run the follow 1000 times:
            map_dfr(1:1000,
                    function(sim_i) {
                      
                      # Generate the first sample x:
                      x <- rnorm(n_i, 0, 1)
                      # And now y with the different variance:
                      y <- rnorm(n_i, 0, sqrt(1.5))
                      
                      # Compute the test results:
                      ttest_result <- t.test(x, y)
                      bartlett_result <- bartlett.test(list(x, y))
                      ks_result <- ks.test(x, y)
                      
                      # Return a table with the settings and decision
                      # to reject with respect to alpha 0.05:
                      tibble(test_type = c("t-test", "Bartlett's test", 
                                           "KS test"),
                             pval = c(ttest_result$p.value,
                                      bartlett_result$p.value,
                                      ks_result$p.value)) %>%
                        mutate(is_rej = as.numeric(pval <= 0.05),
                               sample_size = n_i,
                               sim_id = sim_i)
                      
                    })
          }) %>%
  group_by(test_type, sample_size) %>%
  summarize(power = mean(is_rej))
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# Generate power curve data for these methods
comp_power_table %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample_size, y = power, color = test_type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Sample size n", y = "Power (across 1000 simulations)",
       color = "Test") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")


```

# Main takeaways

Graphics are a great way to see if there are differences in distributions, however... 

+ Graphics should be paired with statistical analyses to determine if what
you see is a _true effect_ versus noise

+ __Even if there is a true effect, you may have limited power to detect it__

+ Some effects are easier to detect than others
  
__Remember: Power is the probability you reject when the null is false__

Things that increase statistical power:

+ Increase sample size

+ Reduce variance/error

+ Increase differences / effects

+ Choose appropriate tests!
