# Things of interest for time series data

Time series can be characterized by three features:

1. __Trends__: Does the variable increase or decrease over time, on average?

2. __Seasonality__: Are there changes in the variable that regularly happen (e.g., every winter, every hour, etc.)? Sometimes called periodicity.

3. __Noise__: Variation in the variable beyond average trends and seasonality.

#### Moving averages are a starting point for visualizing how a trend changes over time

## Moving Average Plots

The _Financial Times_ COVID-19 plots displayed a __moving average__ (sometimes called a __rolling average__)

#### Intuition

1. Divide your data into small subsets ("windows")

2. Compute the average within each window

3. Connect the averages together to make a trend line

--

Sometimes called a __simple moving average__

This is exactly what we did when we learned loess... we called this a _sliding window_, but it's the same thing

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=5}

co2_tbl <- tibble(co2_val = as.numeric(co2)) %>%
  mutate(obs_i = 1:n())

co2_tbl <- co2_tbl %>%
  # We can use the seq() function with dates which is pretty useful!
  mutate(obs_date = seq(as.Date("1/1/1959", format = "%m/%d/%Y"), 
                        by = "month",
                        length.out = n()))

co2_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_date, y = co2_val)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red") + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)",
       title = "CO2 Emissions Over Time")

```


---

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=5}

co2_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_date, y = co2_val)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red") + 
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)",
       title = "CO2 Emissions Over Time")

```


---

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=5}

co2_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_date, y = co2_val)) + 
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)",
       title = "CO2 Emissions Over Time")

```


---

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=5}
library(ggseas)
co2_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_date, y = co2_val)) + 
  geom_line(color="red") +
  stat_rollapplyr(width = 12, align = "right") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)", 
       title = "CO2 Emissions Over Time")
```


---

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=5}
co2_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_date, y = co2_val)) + 
  #geom_line(color="red") +
  stat_rollapplyr(width = 12, align = "right") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)", 
       title = "CO2 Emissions Over Time")

  stat_rollapplyr(width = 12, align = "right") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)", 
       title = "CO2 Emissions Over Time")
```

## How are moving averages computed?

#### Intuition

1. Divide your data into small subsets (_windows_)

2. Compute the average within each window

3. Connect the averages together to make a trend line

--

Mathematically, a moving average can be written as the following:

$$\mu_k = \frac{\sum_{t=k - h + 1}^k X_t}{h}$$

+ Large $h$: Smooth line; captures global trends

+ Small $h$: Jagged/volatile line; captures local trends


---

# R Demo: Working with Time Series

`co2`: the Mauna Loa Atmospheric CO2 Concentration dataset\

+ Contains monthly $\text{CO}^2$ concentration from 1959 to 1997


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=3}

co2_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_i, y = co2_val)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Time index", y = "CO2 (ppm)")

```


---

## Formatting Dates

Can use `as.Date()` to create time indexes.


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=3}

co2_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_date, y = co2_val)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)")

```

Default format is Year/Month/Day. For something else, need to specify `format` in `as.Date()` (e.g., `format = "%m/%d/%Y"`)

---

### Use `scale_x_date()` to create interpretable axis labels 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=4}
co2_tbl[1:26,] %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_date, y = co2_val)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "4 months", date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)") +
  # Modify the x-axis text 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```


---

### Use [`ggseas`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggseas/vignettes/ggseas.html) package to plot moving averages


```{r init-moving, fig.align='center'}
library(ggseas)
co2_tbl %>% ggplot(aes(x = obs_date, y = co2_val)) + geom_line(color = "red") + 
  stat_rollapplyr(width = 12, align = "right") + #<<
  labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)", title = "Width = 12")
```


---

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=5}
library(patchwork)
wid2 <- co2_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_date, y = co2_val)) + 
  geom_line(color="red") +
  stat_rollapplyr(width = 2, align = "right") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)", 
       title = "Width = 2")

wid24 <- co2_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_date, y = co2_val)) + 
  geom_line(color="red") +
  stat_rollapplyr(width = 24, align = "right") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)", 
       title = "Width = 24")
wid2 + wid24
```



---

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=5}
co2_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_date, y = co2_val)) + 
  geom_line(color="red") +
  stat_rollapplyr(width = 100, align = "right") + #<<
  labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)", 
       title = "Width = 100")
```

## Other Moving Averages


Two other common averages: Cumulative moving averages and weighted moving averages.

+ __Cumulative moving average__: The average at time $k$ is the average of all points at and before $k$. Mathematically:

$$\mu_k^{(CMA)} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^k X_t}{k}$$

--

+ __Weighted moving average__: Same as simple moving average, but different measurements get different weights for the average.

$$\mu_k^{(WMA)} = \frac{\sum_{t=k - h + 1}^k X_t \cdot w_t}{ \sum_{t=k - h + 1}^k w_t}$$
--

For the simple moving average, $w_t = 1$ for all time points.

+ May want to up-weight points close in time to $k$.

---

## Working with lags

Time series data is fundamentally different from other data problems we've worked with because measurements are  __not independent__

Obvious example: The temperature today is correlated with temperature yesterday. (_Maybe not in Pittsburgh?_)

--

Important term: __lags__. Used to determine if one time point influences future time points.

Lag 1: Comparing time series at time $t$ with time series at time $t - 1$. 

Lag 2: Comparing time series at time $t$ with time series at time $t - 2$.

And so on...

--

Let's say we have time measurements $(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5)$. 

The $\ell = 1$ lag is $(X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5)$ vs $(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4)$. 

--

The $\ell = 2$ lag is $(X_3, X_4, X_5)$ vs $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$.

Consider: Are previous outcomes (lags) predictive of future outcomes?

---

## Autocorrelation

__Autocorrelation__: Correlation between a time series and a lagged version of itself.

Define $r_{\ell}$ as the correlation between a time series and Lag $\ell$ of that time series.

--

Lag 1: $r_1$ is correlation between $(X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5)$ and $(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4)$ 

Lag 2: $r_2$ is correlation between $(X_3, X_4, X_5)$ and $(X_1,X_2,X_3)$

And so on...

--

Common diagnostic: Plot $\ell$ on x-axis, $r_{\ell}$ on y-axis.

Tells us if correlations are "significantly large" or "significantly small" for certain lags

To make an autocorrelation plot, we use the `acf()` function; the `ggplot` version uses `autoplot()`

---

## Autocorrelation plots


```{r}
library(ggfortify)
auto_corr <- acf(co2_tbl$co2_val, plot = FALSE)
autoplot(auto_corr)
```


---

### Autocorrelation Plots and Seasonality

With strong global trends, autocorrelations will be very positive.

--

#### Helpful: Visualize autocorrelations after removing the global trend (compute moving average with `rollapply()`)


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
wid12 <- co2_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_date, y = co2_val)) + 
  geom_line(color="red") +
  stat_rollapplyr(width = 12, align = "right") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)")

co2_tbl <- co2_tbl %>%
  mutate(mov_ave = 
           zoo::rollapply(co2_val, width = 12, FUN = "mean", 
                          align = "right", fill = NA),
         res = co2_val - mov_ave)

resid_plot <- co2_tbl %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = obs_date, y = res)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Residuals of CO2 (ppm)")

wid12 + resid_plot
```


---

## Autocorrelation Plots and Seasonality

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
autoplot(acf(tail(co2_tbl$res, -11), plot = FALSE))
```

---

### Seasonality Decomposition

Remember that there are three main components to a time series:

1. Average trends

2. Seasonality

3. Noise

--

Use `ggsdc()` (from [`ggseas`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggseas/vignettes/ggseas.html)) to decompose a time series into these three components

+ Plots the observed time series.

+ Plots a loess curve as the global trend.

+ Plots another loess curve on (observed - trend) as the seasonality.

+ Plots the noise (observed - trend - seasonality).

---

### Seasonality Decomposition


```{r, fig.align='center'}
co2_tbl %>%
  ggsdc(aes(obs_date, co2_val), frequency = 12, method = "stl", s.window = 12) + #<<
  geom_line() + labs(x = "Year", y = "CO2 (ppm)")
```

---

## Main Takeaways

#### Fundamental characteristic of time series data: measurements are dependent over time

#### Plotting moving averages is the most common way to visualize time series data

The things to look out for in time series data are:

+ Average trends

+ Seasonality

+ Noise

#### Autocorrelation plots are also useful for assessing average trends and seasonality.

#### In time series especially, axes play an important role, so be responsible!
