  - If you need to miss a lab due to illness, interviews, emergencies, etc., email me 48 hours in advance!

---

## Course Objectives (READ THE SYLLABUS):

### Learn useful principles for making appropriate statistical graphics.

### Critique existing graphs and remake better ones.

--

### Visualize statistical analyses to facilitate communication.

### Pinpoint the statistical claims you can/cannot make from graphics.

### Write and speak publicly about statistical graphics.

--

### Practice tidy data manipulation in `R` using the `tidyverse`

### Practice reproducible workflows with `RMarkdown`

---

## What do I mean by `tidy` data?

Data are often stored in __tabular__ (or matrix) form:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins %>% slice(1:5)
```

--

+ Each row `==` unit of observation, e.g., penguins

--

+ Each column `==` variable/measurement about each observation, e.g., `flipper_length_mm`

--

+ Known as a `data.frame` in base `R` and `tibble` in the `tidyverse`

--

+ Two main variable types: quantitative and categorical

--

__How do we convert data into visualizations?__

---

## [The Grammar of Graphics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0) - by Leland Wilkinson

.pull-left[

All plots can be broken down into core components

1. __data__

2. __geometries__: type of geometric objects to represent data, e.g., points, lines

3. __aesthetics__: visual characteristics of geometric objects to represent data, e.g., position, size

4. __scales__: how each aesthetic is converted into values on the graph, e.g., color scales

5. __stats__: statistical transformations to  summarize data, e.g., counts, means, regression lines

6. __facets__: split data and view as multiple graphs

7. __coordinate system__: 2D space the data are projected onto, e.g., Cartesian coordinates

.pull-right[

[Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) [expanded upon this](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf) with  [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

1. `data`

2. `geom`

3. `aes`: mappings of columns to geometric objects

4. `scale`: one scale for each `aes` variable

5. `stat`

6. `facet`

7. `coord`

8. `labs`: labels/guides for each variable and other parts of the plot, e.g., title, subtitle, caption

9. `theme`: customization of plot layout


]

---

## Start with the `data`

.pull-left[

Access `ggplot2` from the `tidyverse`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = penguins) #<<
```


Or equivalently using `%>%`:

```{r init-plot, fig.show = 'hide'}
penguins %>% #<<
  ggplot()
```


]

--

.pull-right[

__Nothing is displayed__

```{r ref.label = 'init-plot', echo = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
```

]

---

## Add geometric object with columns mapped to aesthetics


.pull-left[

+ Use the `+` operator in `ggplot` to add layers

+ Map `bill_length_mm` to x-axis and `bill_depth_mm` to y-axis

```{r geom-plot, fig.show = 'hide'}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, #<<
             y = bill_depth_mm)) + #<<
  geom_point() #<<
```

+ NOTE we are implicitly saying:

```{r, fig.show = 'hide'}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, #<<
                       y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_point() 
```


]

--

.pull-right[

__And now we have a scatterplot!__

```{r ref.label = 'geom-plot', echo = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
```

]


---

## Modify scale, add statistical summary, and so on...

.pull-left[

+ Adjust global aesthetics outside of `aes`

```{r custom-plot, fig.show = 'hide'}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm,
             y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
  # Adjust alpha of points
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + #<<
  # Add smooth regression line
  stat_smooth(method = "lm") + #<<
  # Flip the x-axis scale
  scale_x_reverse() + #<<
  # Change title & axes labels 
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)", #<<
       y = "Bill depth (mm)", #<<
       title = "Clustering of penguins bills") + #<<
  # Change the theme:
  theme_bw() #<<
  
```


]

--

.pull-right[

__You will be covering more basics in Lab1__

```{r ref.label = 'custom-plot', echo = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
```

## [Edward Tufte's](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) Principles of Data Visualization

Graphics: visually display measured quantities by combining points, lines, coordinate systems, numbers, symbols, words, shading, color

--

#### Goal is to show data and/or communicate a story!

--

+ Induce viewer to think about substance, __not graphical methodology__

+ Make large, complex datasets more coherent 

+ Encourage comparison of different pieces of data

+ __Describe, explore, and identify relationships__

+ __Avoid data distortion and data decoration__

+ Use consistent graph design

--

#### Avoid graphs that lead to misleading conclusions!

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '110%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/ryurko/SURE22-examples/blob/main/figures/lecture_examples/nyt_ex.png?raw=true") 
```
